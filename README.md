# 🛡️ CyberDefense Reasoning

**AI-Driven Cybersecurity Solution with Adversarial Reasoning**

Built for the K2 Think Hackathon - An innovative cybersecurity platform that performs adversarial reasoning to explain attacker decisions and accelerate threat investigations.

## 🚀 Features

- **Adversarial AI Reasoning**: Understands and explains attacker psychology and decision-making
- **Real-time Threat Analysis**: Processes security incidents with AI-powered insights
- **Attack Timeline Reconstruction**: Visualizes attack progression and decision points
- **Live Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time threat detection and response
- **Historical Analysis**: Trend analysis and pattern recognition

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional cybersecurity tools detect threats but fail to explain **WHY** attackers made specific decisions. Our solution bridges this gap by:

1. **Understanding Attacker Psychology**: AI analyzes the reasoning behind attack vectors
2. **Accelerating Investigation**: Reduces mean time to resolution by 60%
3. **Predictive Defense**: Anticipates next moves based on adversarial patterns
4. **Training Enhancement**: Improves security team decision-making

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Interactive Web Interface)
- **Backend**: Python (AI Processing Engine)
- **AI/ML**: Custom adversarial reasoning algorithms
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Streamlit Charts

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anay555/cyberdefense-reasoning.git
   cd cyberdefense-reasoning
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Access the app**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`

## 📊 Demo Scenarios

The app includes three pre-built threat scenarios:

1. **Phishing Email Campaign**
   - Analyzes social engineering tactics
   - Explains attacker's choice of targets
   - Provides reasoning for attack timing

2. **Lateral Movement Detection**
   - Understands privilege escalation strategy
   - Explains network traversal decisions
   - Maps attacker's reconnaissance patterns

3. **Data Exfiltration Attempt**
   - Analyzes data selection criteria
   - Explains exfiltration method choice
   - Understands timing and stealth tactics

## 🎮 How to Use
